// old readme
The project may be open sourced under the lgpl protocol. And I will keep my best to updata function and improved design,so I think it's worthy of your "star it" and follow up.

And you can donwload the "fast_make" folder ，which have many files and manual to help you make the display case at short time.

Because of chinese university admission mechanism,I was admitted to Bioengineering,baiscally it has nothing to do with embedded systems.It ran counter to my wish. I really want to continue learning about embedded systems,so I try to change my major to computer related,this is very hard to do in china,I must had high score at your current major.Good luck to me.

So this project progress is very slow....................................................... Now the code was moved to vscode editor.

Will come funtion(ver2.3): 1.web site control. 2.more animation and perfect LED management code.

Now knew problem(ver2.2): 1.All project mixed with Chinese and English. 2.no any description.
